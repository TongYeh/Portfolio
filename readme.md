## Project
### [Tourism Statistics Analysis in Thailand](https://public.tableau.com/views/-Dashboard-Manoi/sheet14?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Organized the dataset into categories and filtered the necessary data using MS Excel to prepare a data source for creating a Tableau dashboard.
- Used the data to create various graphs suitable for the content.
- Included Thailand's latitude and longitude to display a map of Thailand, allowing filtering by province to view specific data for each province.
- Added buttons to link to other pages for easier navigation.

### Flight Booking System Design
- Researched sample websites and collected requirements from users about their feelings and suggestions for improvements or additional features.  
- Created a DFD Diagram to visualize the flow of data within the system, a Use Case Diagram to match user actions for easier UX/UI design on the website, a User Story to show the steps of system development in each phase, and a Class Diagram to simplify data management.  
- Designed the website using Figma, with functions based on the DFD Diagram and Use Case Diagram.

### [English vocabulary quiz game Using IoT](https://github.com/TongYeh/Project-IoT)
- Displayed the question and answer choices on an LCD screen.  
- Used buttons to select the answer the player thinks is correct.  
- Used LED lights to show the number of incorrect attempts remaining.  
- When all the LEDs turn off (no attempts left) or the game is completed, the final score is displayed.
